-->next():
> The next() method reads the next token (word) from the input until it encounters a whitespace (space, tab, or newline).
> It does not include the whitespace character in the returned string.
> After reading the token, the scanner remains at the beginning of the next line.
  
Example:
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter a sentence: ");
String word = scanner.next();

-->nextLine():
> The nextLine() method reads the entire line from the input, including any spaces until the end of the line.
> It returns the input as a string, including the newline character at the end.
> After reading the line, the scanner moves to the beginning of the next line.
  
Example:
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter a sentence: ");
String sentence = scanner.nextLine();
